# Real Time Image Detection

This program will detect the Metin2 window, capture the image and detect in real time the fish using Cascade recognising, a  supervised Machine learning algoritm.

## How it works

- When starting, the program will find the game window and save the details
- Load the trained Machine learning model
- capture in real time the game window
- detect the fish and draw a rectangle around it
- display the processed images and the FPS the program runs at

The program was made from scratch with the help of this guide https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KecMlLUuiE4&list=PL1m2M8LQlzfKtkKq2lK5xko4X-8EZzFPI
